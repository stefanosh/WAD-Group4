   Description of the project :
   In this project we will implement a website where users can book tickets for cinema movies. At the top of the page the user can choose from a variety of options, like upcoming movies, movies that are playing, can watch popular movie trailers and he also has access to a login page. The user has to register for a new account, in order to book movies, (he can also receive points for being a frequent client of the cinema, and exchange those for movies ticket discounts), rate movies etc. If he's a student he can receive a 20% discount for movie tickets, if he buys them using the service website.
